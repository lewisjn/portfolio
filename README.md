# Jackie Lewis Portfolio Samples

Hello! This is a collection of some of the work I have done over the past couple of years.

I largely focus on creating custom content in HTML, and CSS. While I have some experience with git, most of the content we managed is served through the Learning Management System, Canvas. You may notice some unique formatting and a very heavy use of inline CSS, which is largely due to limitations of the platform I have been working on.

I am also proficient with graphic design (typically with the Adobe Creative Suite) and created most of the assets you'll see here!

A lot of what I work on ends up rendering in custom applications for internal websites so unfortunately I don't have many live examples or great screenshots, but I am happy to provide more context if needed.
