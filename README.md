# Jackie Lewis Portfolio Samples

Hello! This is a collection of some of the work I have done over the past couple of years.

I largely focus on creating custom content in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. While I have some experience with git, most of the content we managed is served through custom CMS systems.

I am also proficient with graphic design (typically with the Adobe suite of tools) and create or have input most of the assets you'll see here!

A lot of what I work on ends up rendering in custom applications for internal websites so unfortunately I don't have many live examples or great screenshots, but I am happy to provide more context if needed.

You may notice some unique formatting or a very heavy use of inline CSS which is largely due to limitations of the platforms I have been working on.
